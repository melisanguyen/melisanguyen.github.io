Credo<br>
I believe that, whatever design problem you need to solve, you should face it with rationality, logic<br> and careful analysis if you want to get to the right idea. Graphic design is always a synthetic work:<br> you need to reduce and remove until you reach the core of the message. When you work with typ-<br>
ography and lettering, the essential goal is to obtain the best possible legibility. To achieve this re-<br> sult, it is fundamental to know typography and its history. The computer has become an essential t-<br> ool but its undisputed utility and versatility cannot replace knowledge. As extraordinary as this in-<br>strument can be, you need deep roots and the &nbsp;&nbsp;ability to express yourself even with the simplest to-<br>ols such as a pencil in order to use it corre &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ctly. A good software does not necessarily create<br> good graphics. Graphics is not an indepe &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endent art, but a service. To obtain a correct res-<br>ult, you need to put yourself on the side &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the observer, on the side of the public. A go-<br>od designer is the one who offers a go &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;od service through communication, not the o-<br>ne who wants to surprise at any cost, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither the one who wants to show how good<br> he is. A designer is good if he can so &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lve a problem, if he puts forward a useful s-<br>olution. I believe that these rules could be a good start for a career in design.
